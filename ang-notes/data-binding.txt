Data Binding Means How the data transfers  from component to template or template to component
In angular, we can do 
  i. one way Data Binding:
     there are three ways
     a.  string Interpolation: it alwaYS BRINGS DATA FROM COMPONENT(ts) to TEMPLATE(html). wrap the variable in double braces
     html:  <h1>Hi, my name is {{x}} </h1>
      ts: x="prasad"

      but the probelm it bring even boolean values as strings
      b. property Binding: You can assign attributes/properties from COMPONENT(ts) to TEMPLATE(html) using square brackets([])
       html:  <button [disabled]="isDisabled">click me</button>
      ts: isDisabled= false

      c. event Binding: it is used to send data from TEMPLATE(html) to COMPONENT(ts) using paranthesis on events
      html:  <button (click)="display()">click me</button>
      ts: function display(){
        alert("helloooo")
      }

  ii. Two Way Data Binding: it is used to send data from component to template and template to omponent at a time
  To achieve this we need to use "ngModel" directives
